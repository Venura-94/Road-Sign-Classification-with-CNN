# Road Sign Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

#### Note :: Data set is too large to add to the Github 

In this hands-on project, i have trained deep learning models known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images. 
This project has practical applications, particularly in the realm of self-driving cars.

1. Import libraries and datasets.
2. Visualize images.
3. Convert images to grayscale and perform normalization.
4. Build a deep learning model.
5. Compile and train the deep learning model.
6. Assess the trained model's performance.

## Learning Objectives
